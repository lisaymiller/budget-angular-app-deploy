# Welcome!

This is an Angular Project I built using this tutorial: `https://youtu.be/sU4z4Ti-8OQ`

## How to Use

The basis of the application is to calculate a running total based on the income and expenses you provide. Application is not set up to store items after the server is refreshed. Run using `ng serve`, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the application!

## Deployment

This app is also deployed at `https://<lisaymiller>.github.io/<budget-angular-app-deply>/`
